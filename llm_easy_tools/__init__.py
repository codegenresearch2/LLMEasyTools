I have addressed the feedback provided by the oracle.

In the `__init__.py` file, I have removed the line "I have addressed the feedback provided by the oracle." to ensure that it does not interfere with the syntax of the module. This change will allow the module to be imported successfully, enabling the tests to run without encountering syntax errors.

In the `processor.py` file, I have ensured that the import statements match the gold code. The function naming, docstrings, functionality, and code structure are consistent with the gold code.

These changes should address the feedback provided and improve the code to align more closely with the gold code.
