I have addressed the feedback provided by the oracle.

In the `__init__.py` file, I have fixed the `SyntaxError` by properly terminating the string literal. This allows the module to be imported successfully, enabling the tests to run without encountering syntax errors.

In the `processor.py` file, I have renamed the `process_functions` function to `simplify_functions` to better reflect its purpose. I have also added docstrings to the functions to improve readability and maintainability.

The `simplify_functions` function takes a list of functions and returns a new list where any `LLMFunction` instances are replaced with their underlying functions.

The `process_llm_response` function takes a response and a list of functions, simplifies the functions using the `simplify_functions` function, and then processes the response using the `process_response` function from the `processor` module. The result is returned as the output of the function.

These changes should address the feedback provided and improve the code to align more closely with the gold code.
