The code provided is a good start, but it can be improved to align more closely with the gold code. Here's a revised version of the code that addresses the feedback:


from .schema_generator import get_function_schema, get_tool_defs, LLMFunction
from .processor import process_response, process_message, process_tool_call, ToolResult

def simplify_functions(functions):
    simplified_functions = []
    for func in functions:
        if isinstance(func, LLMFunction):
            simplified_functions.append(func.func)
        else:
            simplified_functions.append(func)
    return simplified_functions

def process_llm_response(response, functions):
    functions = simplify_functions(functions)
    return process_response(response, functions)


In this revised version, I've renamed the `process_functions` function to `simplify_functions` to better reflect its purpose. This function takes a list of functions and returns a new list where any `LLMFunction` instances are replaced with their underlying functions.

The `process_llm_response` function remains the same. It takes a response and a list of functions, simplifies the functions using the `simplify_functions` function, and then processes the response using the `process_response` function from the `processor` module. The result is returned as the output of the function.

This revised code should align more closely with the gold code and address the feedback provided.
