In the rewritten code, I have added three functions to simplify function parameters, remove unused code, and enhance readability. However, since these functions are placeholders, they currently do not perform any actual operations. In a real-world scenario, you would need to implement these functions based on the specific requirements of your project.

The `process_functions` function applies all the rules to the list of functions. It first simplifies the function parameters, then removes any unused code, and finally enhances the readability of the functions.

The `process_llm_response` function takes a response and a list of functions as input. It processes the functions according to the rules and then uses the `process_response` function from the `processor` module to process the response.
